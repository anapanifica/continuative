,"While he was yet speaking , a representative of the presiding officer of the synagogue came , saying : “ Your daughter has died ; do not bother the Teacher any longer . ”","But as he was saying these things , a cloud formed and began to overshadow them . As they entered into the cloud , they became afraid .","But even as he was approaching , the demon hurled him to the ground and violently threw him into a convulsion . However , Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit and healed the boy and gave him back to his father .","And they were all astounded at the majestic power of God . While they were all astonished at all the things he was doing , he said to his disciples :","For example , when you are going with your legal opponent to a ruler , while on the way , get to work to settle the dispute with him so that he may not summon you before the judge , and the judge deliver you to the court officer , and the court officer throw you into prison .","In time the slave said , ‘ Master , what you ordered has been done , and still there is room . ’","If , in fact , he cannot do so , then while that one is yet far away , he sends out a body of ambassadors and sues for peace .","So he got up and went to his father . While he was still a long way off , his father caught sight of him and was moved with pity , and he ran and embraced him and tenderly kissed him .","After hearing that , Jesus said to him , “ There is still one thing lacking about you : Sell all the things you have and distribute the proceeds to the poor , and you will have treasure in the heavens ; and come be my follower . ”","But as they were untying the colt , its owners said to them : “ Why are you untying the colt ? ”","While he was still speaking , look ! a crowd , and the man called Judas , one of the Twelve , was leading them , and he approached Jesus to kiss him .","But Peter said : “ Man , I do not know what you are saying . ” And instantly , while he was still speaking , a rooster crowed .","He is not here , but has been raised up . Recall how he spoke to you while he was yet in Gal′i·lee ,","But while they were still not believing for sheer joy and amazement , he said to them : “ Do you have something there to eat ? ”","He then said to them : “ These are my words that I spoke to you while I was yet with you , that all the things written about me in the Law of Moses and in the Prophets and Psalms must be fulfilled . ”","As he was blessing them , he was parted from them and taken up to heaven .",sum

<p>This site presents <strong>the Continuative Expressions
Database</strong>, a typological database of continuative (‘still’)
expressions in the world’s languages. The principles of data collection
and the analysis of the continuative expressions included in the
database are described in the following paper:</p>
<pre><code>Panova, Anastasia. 2023. Towards a typology of continuative expressions. Submitted.</code></pre>
<p>If you use the database in your research, please cite the
aforementioned paper.</p>
<hr />
<div id="sample" class="section level3">
<h3>Sample</h3>
<p>The database contains information on 177 continuative expressions in
136 languages. The stratified (sub-)sample used in (Panova 2023)
includes 154 continuative expressions in 120 languagues.</p>

<h3>Structure of the database</h3>
<p>The main part of the database is a <strong>.csv table</strong> shown
<a href="#data">here</a>. The rows of the table correspond to individual
continuative expressions. The first few columns correspond to metadata
(language name, references to a description and examples, etc.), the
rest of the columns contain information on four parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li>morphosyntactic type,<br />
</li>
<li>emphatic vs. non-emphatic status,</li>
<li>uses outside the continuative domain,<br />
</li>
<li>meaning in combination with negation.</li>
</ul>
